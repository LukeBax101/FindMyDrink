1. Complete the prerequisites from the website above to get node and other needed software on computer, not sure how much of the database ODBC driver or SQLCMD you'll
        actually need. (might be worth checking if you can do it without it. If you were to need one of them though, I'd imagine it'd be the
        ODBC driver rather than the SQLCMD so it might be worth adding the driver if it doesn't work in the first place without it and testing
        it again without the SQLCMD thingy)

2. Follow the rest of the steps (you should already have the database and it's firewall set up to allow your connection, you may need to give
        it your new ip address)

3. Follow the instructions to build a node project, before you create the first file for it, take a look at the file structure, you should have a
        node_modules folder like the one in this folder

4. Copy everything (except the node_modules folder, you won't actually need the backup folder either so you can leave that as well if you want)
        from this folder into the folder which you created the node project in, it should now look very similar to this folder.

5. Now once you have a command line terminal located in this folder, run the command node server.js (it should throw out some messages saying
        it's connected to the database)

6. Go to the browser and type the url "http://localhost:8080/" in. This should give you the website.
